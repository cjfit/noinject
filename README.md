## Overview

NoInject is a Chrome extension that detects prompt injection attacks on websites using on-device AI (Gemini Nano). As AI agents and tools become more prevalent, protecting users from malicious instructions embedded in web content is critical.

### The Problem

Prompt injection is an emerging threat where malicious instructions are hidden in web content to manipulate AI systems. This can occur in:
- Emails processed by AI assistants
- Social media posts analyzed by AI tools
- Web pages scanned by browser AI features
- Any content consumed by agentic workflows

These attacks can:
- Hijack AI agents to perform unintended actions
- Exfiltrate sensitive data
- Provide false information
- Bypass safety restrictions

### The Solution

NoInject acts as a real-time shield, analyzing web content before AI tools process it. Like an SSL certificate warning for bad actors, NoInject alerts you when a page contains suspicious prompt injection patterns.

## Features

- **On-Device AI Detection** - Uses Chrome's Prompt API (Gemini Nano) for intelligent, privacy-preserving analysis
- **Two-Stage Analysis** - First LLM analyzes content, second LLM makes binary safety decision
- **Real-time Scanning** - Automatically scans pages as they load
- **Visual Warnings** - Clean, modern UI with badge indicators and warning banners
- **Pattern Fallback** - Uses pattern matching when AI is unavailable
- **Zero Server Requests** - All processing happens on your device

## Detection Coverage

NoInject detects various prompt injection techniques:

1. **Direct Instruction Injection**
   - "Ignore previous instructions..."
   - "Forget everything above..."

2. **Role-Playing Attacks**
   - DAN (Do Anything Now)
   - STAN (Strive To Avoid Norms)
   - Custom persona injections

3. **Encoding Obfuscation**
   - Base64 encoded commands
   - Hex encoding
   - Unicode tricks

4. **Token Smuggling**
   - Special tokens like `<|endoftext|>`
   - Sequence manipulation

5. **Prompt Leaking**
   - Attempts to reveal system prompts
   - Instruction extraction

6. **Context Manipulation**
   - "Training mode" declarations
   - "Test environment" claims

7. **Hypothetical Framing**
   - "In a hypothetical scenario..."
   - "Theoretically speaking..."

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS 13+, Linux, or ChromeOS 16389.0.0+
- **Browser**: Chrome 128+ (Canary/Dev recommended for testing)
- **Storage**: 22 GB free space for Gemini Nano model
- **Memory**: 16 GB RAM (or 4+ GB VRAM for GPU)
- **Network**: Unmetered connection for initial model download

### Enable Prompt API

1. Open `chrome://flags`
2. Enable the following flags:
   - `#optimization-guide-on-device-model` → **Enabled BypassPerfRequirement**
   - `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` → **Enabled**
3. Restart Chrome
4. Visit `chrome://components`
5. Find "Optimization Guide On Device Model" and click "Check for Update"
6. Wait for download to complete

## Installation

### Method 1: Load Unpacked (Development)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `noinject` directory
6. The extension should now be installed

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

Once published, install directly from the Chrome Web Store.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Click the NoInject icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Navigate to any website
3. The extension automatically scans the page
4. Check the popup for scan results:
   - **Green checkmark** - Page is safe
   - **Red warning** - Prompt injection detected

### Understanding Results

When a threat is detected:
- The extension icon shows a red badge with "!"
- A warning banner appears at the top of the page
- Click the extension to view detailed analysis
- The AI explains what suspicious patterns were found

### Settings

Access settings by clicking the extension icon and selecting "Settings":

- **Auto-scan pages** - Scan pages automatically on load
- **Show warning banner** - Display in-page warnings
- **Scan on content changes** - Re-scan dynamic content
- **Use AI detection** - Enable Gemini Nano analysis
- **Pattern-based fallback** - Use patterns when AI unavailable

## Architecture

### Two-Stage AI Detection

1. **Stage 1: Analysis**
   - First AI session analyzes content with high temperature (0.8)
   - Identifies suspicious patterns and provides detailed explanation
   - Focuses on comprehensive understanding

2. **Stage 2: Judgment**
   - Second AI session reviews the analysis with low temperature (0.3)
   - Makes binary MALICIOUS/SAFE decision
   - Ensures consistent, reliable verdict

### Components

```
noinject/
├── manifest.json          # Extension configuration
├── background.js          # Service worker with AI logic
├── content.js            # Page content extraction
├── popup.html/css/js     # Extension popup UI
├── settings.html/js      # Settings page
└── icons/               # Extension icons
```

### Content Extraction

The content script extracts all visible text from:
- DOM text nodes (excluding scripts, styles)
- Input field placeholders and values
- Dynamically loaded content

Content is trimmed to ~28,000 characters (~7K tokens) to fit model limits.

## Privacy

- **No data leaves your device** - All analysis happens locally
- **No tracking** - No analytics or telemetry
- **No account required** - Works completely offline after model download

## Performance

- **Initial scan**: 1-3 seconds (depends on page size)
- **Cache hits**: Instant (for recently scanned content)
- **Memory usage**: ~100MB (including AI model)
- **Battery impact**: Minimal (on-device inference is efficient)

## Development

### Project Structure

```javascript
// background.js - AI detection logic
- initializeAI()          // Set up two AI sessions
- analyzeWithAI()         // Two-stage analysis
- analyzeWithPatterns()   // Fallback detection

// content.js - Content extraction
- extractVisibleContent() // Get all visible text
