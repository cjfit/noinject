# Ward Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

## How Ward Handles Your Data

Ward operates in two primary modes: **Local Mode** and **Cloud Mode**. The data we handle depends on which mode you are using.

### 1. Local Mode (Default)
**In Local Mode, all threat scanning happens directly on your device.**

**We do NOT collect:**
- Websites you visit
- Content you scan
- Browsing history

Everything stays on your computer. No page content is sent to our servers.

### 2. Cloud Mode (Optional)
**In Cloud Mode, necessary data is sent to our secure cloud server for advanced AI analysis.**

**What we send:**
- **Page Content:** The text content of the page you are viewing is sent to our server.
  - *Privacy Protection:* We **locally redact** sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like phone numbers, credit card numbers, SSNs, and IP addresses *before* the data leaves your browser.
- **Page URL:** The specific web address you are scanning.
- **Installation ID:** An anonymous ID to manage request quotas.
- **Your Email:** Sent only if you are signed in, to verify your account status.

**How we use it:**
- The redacted content and URL are processed transiently by our AI models to detect threats.
- This data is **not stored** permanently and is used solely for the immediate security scan.

## Account Information

**Your Google Account Email** - Collected only if you choose to sign in.

**Why we need it:**
- To create and manage your account
- To sync settings across devices
- To provide customer support
- To enable premium features and higher scanning quotas

## Your Control

- **Sign-in is optional:** Ward works fully without an account.
- **Cloud Mode is optional:** You can stick to Local Mode if you prefer no data transfer.
- **Revoke access:** You can revoke Google Sign-In access anytime via your Google Account settings.
